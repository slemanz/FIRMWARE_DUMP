# 1. Concepts

_Code reuse matters._

Firmware for microcontrollers has conventionally been developed for a specific
application using functional design methodologies.

That typically tie the low-level hardware directly into the application code,
making the software difficult if not impossible to reuse and port on the same hardware
architectures let alone reuse on a different architecture.

The dramatic cost decreases in memory, larger memory
availability, and more efficient CPU architectures are removing the resource-constrained
nature that firmware developers have been stuck with. The result is that developers
can now start utilizing design methods that decouple the application code from the
hardware and allow a radical increase in code reuse.

## Portable Firmware

- **Portable firmware:** embedded software that is designed to run on more then one
microcontroller or processor architecture with little or no modification.

High-level application code becomes tightly coupled
to low-level microcontroller code, which makes separating, reusing, or porting the
application code costly, time consuming, and buggy. The end result—developers just
start from scratch every time.

In order to keep up with the rapid development pace in today’s design cycles,
developers need to be highly skilled in developing portable firmware. Portable firmware
is embedded software that is designed to run on more than one microcontroller or
processor architecture with little to no modification.

For development teams to successfully enjoy the benefits of portable code use,
extra time and money needs to be spent up-front. However, after the initial investment,
development cycles have a jump-start to potentially decrease development time by
months versus the traditional embedded-software design cycle. The long-term benefits
and cost savings usually overshadow the up-front design costs, along with the potential
to speed up the development schedule.

The decision to develop portable firmware should not be taken lightly. In order
to develop truly portable and reusable firmware, there are a few characteristics that a
developer should review and make sure that the firmware will exhibit.

The software needs to be broken up into
manageable pieces with minimal dependencies between modules and similar functions
being grouped together.

## Modularity

Modularity emphasizes that a program’s functionality should be separated into
independent modules that may be interchangeable. Each module contains a header
and source file with the ability to execute specialized system functions that are exposed
through the module’s interface. The primary benefit of employing modularity in an
embedded system is that the program is broken up into smaller pieces that are organized
based on purpose and function.

Ignoring the preceding facts and lumping large amounts of code into a single
module, even if it is well organized or makes sense in the beginning, usually results in
a decay into a chaos and a software architecture that resembles spaghetti. Breaking
a program up into separate modules is so important when developing portable and
reusable firmware because the independence each module exhibits allows it to be easily
moved from one application to the next, or in some cases even from one platform to the
next.

Each module added to a program does come with the disadvantage that the
compiler will need to open, process, compile, and close the module. The result in the
“old days” would have been slower compilation times. Development machines today
are so fast and efficient that increased compile time is no longer an excuse for writing
bulking, clunky code.

## Module Coupling and Cohesion

For a module to be truly
portable, it must exhibit low coupling to other modules within the code base and a high
level of cohesion.

- **Coupling** refers to how closely related different modules or classes are to each other and the
degree to which they are interdependent.

- **Cohesion** refers to the degree to which module elements belong together.

Portable and reusable software attempts to create modules that are loosely coupled
and have high cohesion. Modules with these characteristics are usually easy to reuse and
maintain. Consider what would happen in a tightly coupled system if a single module
were changed. A single change would result in changes being forced in at least one other
module, if not more, and it could be time consuming to hunt down all the necessary
changes.

## Following a Standard

The long-term support for C and its general-purpose use has resulted in language
extensions and non-standard versions that need to be avoided. Using any construct
that is not in the standard will result in specialized modifications to the code base that
can obfuscate the code.

In addition to using the C standard, developers should also restrict their use to well-­
defined constructs that are easy to understand and maintain and are fully specified. For
example, standards such as MISRA-C and Secure-C exist to provide recommendations
on a C subset and they should be used to develop firmware. MISRA-C was developed for
the automotive industry, but the recommendations have proven to be so successful at
producing quality software that other industries are adopting the recommendations.

Developers should not view a standard as a restriction but instead as a method for
improving the quality and portability of the firmware that they develop.

## Portability Issues in C

- **Data Types:** the storage size for an integer is not defined within the ANSI-C standard.
The compiler vendors have the choice to define the storage size for the variable based on
what they deem will be the most efficient and/or appropriate. The portability issues arising 
from integers, the most commonly used data type, are solved in a relatively simplistic way.
The library header file stdint.h defines fixed-width integers.

- **Structures and Unions:** A developer can declare a structure containing three members, x, y,
and z. When a variable is declared of type Axis_t, the data members will be created in the order
x, y, and z in memory. However, the C standard does not specify how the data members
will be byte aligned. The compiler has the option to align the data members in any way
that it chooses. The result could be that x, y, and z occupy contiguous memory, or there
could be padding bytes. 

- **Bit Fields:** are declared within a structure and are meant to allow a developer to save
memory space by tightly packing data members that don’t occupy an entire data space.
An example of using bit fields is to declare a flag within a structure that has a true or false
value. The problem with bit fields is that the implementation is completely undefined by
the standard. The compiler implementers get to decide how the bit field will be stored
in memory, including byte alignment and whether the bit field can cross a memory
boundary. Another problem with bit fields is that while they may appear to save
memory, the resulting code required to access the bit field may be large and slow, which
can affect the real-time performance of accessing it.

- **Preprocessor Directives:** Compiler vendors have the ability to add preprocessor 
directives that are not part of the standard. For example, #warning is a commonly used
preprocessor directive that is not supported by C90 or C99! The #error preprocessor directive
is part of the standard, and #warning was added by compiler vendors to allow a developer to
raise a compilation warning. Developers who rely heavily on #warning may port code to a
compiler that doesn’t recognize #warning as a valid preprocessor directive or may recognize
it as having a different purpose! 

## Embedded-Software Architecture

Firmware development in the early days used truly resource-constrained
microcontrollers. Every single bit had to be squeezed from both code and data memory
spaces. Software reusability was a minor concern, and programs were monolithically
developed.

A software architecture is the blueprint from which a developer implements software.
A software architecture is literally analogous to the blueprint an architect would
use to design a building or a bridge.

A layered architecture can provide a functional boundary between different
components within the software. Take, for example, low-level driver code that makes the
microcontroller work. Including driver code directly within the application code tightly
couples the microcontroller to the application code. Since application code normally
contains algorithms that may be used across multiple products, mixing in low-­level
microcontroller code will make it difficult and time consuming to reuse the code. Instead,
a developer who architects layered software can separate the application and low-level
code, allowing both layers to be reused in other applications or on different hardware.

Many formal models exist for developing layered software architectures, including
the well-known OSI model, which contains over seven layers. A developer should
examine their requirements and their portability and reuse needs and pick the simplest
architecture that can meet their requirements. Don’t be tempted to build a 30-layer
software architecture if three layers will meet the requirements! The goal is to avoid
complex spaghetti code that is intertwined and entangled and instead develop layered
lasagna code! (Just the thought makes my stomach growl!).

## Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL)

The most interesting firmware layer that developers now have the ability to utilize is
the hardware abstraction layer (HAL). A HAL is an interface that provides the application
developer with a standard function set that can be used to access hardware functions
without a detailed understanding of how the hardware works.

HALs are essentially APIs designed to interact with hardware, and a properly
designed HAL provides developers with many benefits, such as software that:

- is portable
- is reusable
- has a lower cost (result of reuse)
- is abstracted (I don’t need to know how the microcontroller does
what it does)
- has fewer bugs due to repeated use
- is scalable (moving to other MCUs within a part family)

### SOFTWARE TERMINOLOGY:

- **Driver Layer** refers to the software layer that contains low-level, microcontroller-specific
software. The driver layer forms the basis from which higher-level software interacts with and
controls the microcontroller.

- **Board-Support Package (BSP)** refers to driver code that is dependent upon lower-level
microcontroller driver code. These drivers usually support external integrated circuits such as
EEPROM or flash chips.

- **Middleware** refers to the software layer that contains software dependent upon the lower-
lying hardware drivers but does not directly contain application code. Application code is
usually dependent upon the software contained within this middle layer of software.

- **Application Layer** refers to a software layer used for system- and application-specific
purposes that is decoupled from the underlying hardware. The application code meets
product-specific features and requirements.

- **Configuration Layer** refers to a software layer used to configure components within the layer.

- **Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)** refers to a firmware layer that replaces hardware-level
accesses with higher-level function calls.

- **Application programming interface (API)** refers to functions, routines, and libraries that are
used to accelerate application software development.
