# 1. Concepts

_Code reuse matters._

Firmware for microcontrollers has conventionally been developed for a specific
application using functional design methodologies.

That typically tie the low-level hardware directly into the application code,
making the software difficult if not impossible to reuse and port on the same hardware
architectures let alone reuse on a different architecture.

The dramatic cost decreases in memory, larger memory
availability, and more efficient CPU architectures are removing the resource-constrained
nature that firmware developers have been stuck with. The result is that developers
can now start utilizing design methods that decouple the application code from the
hardware and allow a radical increase in code reuse.

## Portable Firmware




- **Portable firmware:** embedded software that is designed to run on more then one microcontroller or processor architecture with little or no modification.
