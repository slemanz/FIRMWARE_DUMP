# 5. Documenting

Writing and maintaining documentation is highly important, yet it is often a neglected
element of embedded-software development. Engineers typically start a project strong,
keeping documentation synchronized with written code. As the project progresses,
schedule and cost pressures intensify due to antsy clients and perhaps even the boss
breathing down the developers’ necks. The result is that the developers bury their heads
in the code and just crank it out as fast as possible. Developers start to take shortcuts to
save time, such as skipping documentation, telling themselves that once the software is
written they’ll go back and update the documentation.

There are many benefits to having well-documented embedded software, such as:

- Having a reference to look up API and HAL calls (a software manual)
- Having a document that communicates implementation details and intent
- Decreased time to train engineers (just review the documentation!)
- A clear and concise description of the standards used to develop the
software, such as coding or industry standards (improved readability)
- Improved maintenance and overall costs resulting from having
access to a reference rather than having to “wing it” and decode large
amounts of code
- Faster speed to make updates and changes to the software

## Easing the Documentation Load

The problem with the way many developers create documentation is that they are
expected to create multiple documentation sources.
