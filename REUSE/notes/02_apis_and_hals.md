# 2. APIs and HALs

Designing a HAL is a great first step toward developing firmware that is
reusable and hardware independent. The HAL, or hardware abstraction layer, provides
the application developer with a standard function set that can be used to access
hardware functions without a detailed understanding of how the underlying hardware
works.

## APIs Versus HALs

An API is an application programming interface that defines a set of routines,
protocols, and tools for creating an application. An API defines the high-level interface
of the behavior and capabilities of the component and its inputs and outputs. An API
should be created so that it is generic and implementation independent. This allows
the API to be used in multiple applications with changes being made only to the API
implementation and not to the general interface or behavior.

A HAL is a hardware abstraction layer that defines a set of routines, protocols, and
tools for interacting with the hardware. A HAL is focused on creating abstract, high-­
level functions that can be used to make the hardware do something without requiring
detailed knowledge of how the hardware is doing it. A HAL can come in extremely handy
for developers who work with multiple microcontroller hardware types and need to port
applications from one platform to the next.

APIs and HALs are related. It could be argued that they do nearly the same thing.
The difference is that an API is designed to make application software easier while a HAL
is designed to make interacting with low-level hardware easier. An embedded system
that is well designed would have both a HAL to interact with the low-level hardware
and an API that interacts with the HAL to produce a set of APIs that simplify application
development.

## The API and HAL Landscape

The first, and probably the most famously known, are the Arduino APIs.2 Every
Arduino board can use common software components and function calls from
the Arduino software library on any Arduino-based board. Arduino provides huge
flexibility in hardware use, and most developers using Arduino know little to nothing
about microcontrollers and sometimes even programming.

Teams can immediately start developing their application code rather than having to
spend months diving into highly technical datasheets trying to understand how the
microcontroller works.

## Potential Issues

All APIs and HALs are not created equal. Whether a development team is using an open
source standard or a microcontroller vendor–provided standard, or have decided to roll
their own standard, there are a few concerns that developers need to be aware of that can
result in major software issues.

- Tied to a single toolchain
- Copyright infringement
- Execution efficiency
- Functionality limitations resulting from abstraction
- Integration issues
- Code bloat
- Readability

Developers therefore need to
look at how the provided software is architected and take some measurements to ensure
that the execution efficiency is acceptable.

Abstracting a peripheral is a great technique to allow application developers to
focus on the application and not worry about the underlying hardware. The problem is
that through abstraction, sometimes little details and functionality get lost that could
improve execution efficiency or simplify a task.

Additional potential issues exist, but these are the ones that developers will find
have the greatest impact on their development efforts. Each issue needs to be carefully
considered and weighed before diving into a development effort and selecting or
building the API.

## Characteristics Every HAL Should Exhibit

1. Contains a Well-Defined Coding Standard
2. Reasonable Documentation and Comments: The documentation doesn’t have to be a book,
but a few clear and concise comments sprinkled throughout the source code that explain to
an engineer how to configure and use the HAL is critical.
3. Can Be Compiled in Any Modern Compiler
4. Abstract Useful Hardware Features
5. Easily Extensible
6. Modular and Adaptable
7. Deterministic and Well-Understood Behavior
8. Error-Handling and Diagnostic Capabilities: Error handling doesn’t have to be perfect.
Returning a value indicating if the intended interfaced call was successful or not could be enough.
Alternatively, perhaps requiring a full check on the peripheral to ensure that it is configured
properly is necessary.
10. Integrated Regression Testing

APIs are the basic building blocks that applications are built upon. A good API should be small,
efficient, and easily extensible. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to use both
good and bad APIs. Developers can try to quantify what a good API is and what a bad API is,
but the fact of the matter is that developers will know it when they see it.

---

The only time that One Module should be used to rule them ALL is if that one module is a
configuration module that is used to enable and disable features and configure the project.

---

Software engineers are very optimistic creatures. If the software runs correctly one time, it
is often assumed that it will always run correctly no matter what the circumstances may be.
Unfortunately, this is not the case!

On numerous occasions, I have encountered application code that just did not seem to work
the way that was expected. After being called in to help identify the issue, I discovered that the
developers not only didn’t include any error handling or checks in their software, they also did
not check return values for functions.

## To Build or Not to Build

Chances are, there is no HAL on the planet for microcontrollers that currently meets all
the characteristics that we just discussed or that meets every development team’s needs.
Certainly, some good HALs exist, but no single microcontroller HAL brings the best of
all worlds. Some may be complete overkill for the application space or company needs
while others may not go far enough. In these circumstances, a development team may
need to build their own HAL.

The team may be able to just use the HAL provided by the
microcontroller vendor. This would save the time and cost of developing a HAL from
scratch. However, it also ties the development team into that vendor’s ecosystem
and may make it extremely costly to change microcontrollers later on down the road.

## A First Look at a HAL

To a
developer, these HALs are nothing more than a header and source module with a pre-­
defined function set. We will be going into a great deal of detail on this later, but to give a
sneak peak, here an example example HAL for a GPIO peripheral:

```C
void Dio_Init(const DioConfig_t * const Config);
DioPinState_t Dio_ChannelRead(DioChannel_t Channel);
void Dio_ChannelWrite(DioChannel_t Channel, DioPinState_t State);
void Dio_ChannelToggle(DioChannel_t Channel);
void Dio_ChannelModeSet (DioChannel_t Channel, DioMode_t Mode);
void Dio_ChannelDirectionSet(DioChannel_t Channel, PinModeEnum_t Mode);
void Dio_RegisterWrite(uint32_t Address, TYPE Value);
TYPE Dio_RegisterRead(uint32_t Address);
void Dio_CallbackRegister (DioCallback_t Function, TYPE (*CallbackFunction) (type));
```

## The API Scope

The API is a tool available to developers that can be used to dramatically speed up
software development. Developers who want to write code that is reusable will break
their software up into logical components that exhibit certain functions and features
that are useful building blocks for the application.

It is important to note that a HAL is really a specialized case for an API. Both APIs
and HALs are used to abstract out the underlying component details and speed up
software development.

Embedded-software developers might wonder if there are any API standards that
can be used to reuse code and speed up development. At first thought, the answer is that
there aren’t any. The truth is, though, that there are API standards that we use that we
aren’t even aware exist! Take, for example, any RTOS that is on the market today. Each
RTOS has its own API standard that it adheres to that allows developers to consistently
use and reuse the RTOS.

## API Characteristics to Look For

1. **Using const Frequently:** The const keyword tells the compiler that the data being referred 
to by the const variable is read-only. The actual memory location may be writable, but
through the variable the data should be treated as read-only. A good API will declare many
parameters as const because it is just using the data to perform useful work and wants to protect
the data that it is using.

2. **Easily Understood Naming Conventions:** A good API is easy to read and understand. As a developer
becomes familiar with the API, they should be able to naturally remember the different API calls based
on the function that is needed.

3. **Consistent Look and Feel:** The APIs for any component should have a consistent look and feel.
They should follow a similar standard and be intuitive to the developer. APIs that are not consistent
are error prone, and developers often find themselves digging through the documentation trying
to figure out what is going on.

4. **Well Documented:** Some APIs will even provide initial
and post conditions, which is awesome! There should be examples that show how to use
the APIs and maybe even a few that show a developer what not to do and identify the
primary pain points developers will encounter when using the component.

5. **Flexible and Configurable:** APIs are at a high enough level that sometimes one size does not fit 
all. A good API should be flexible enough to work on multiple hardware platforms and provide a HAL to deal
with differences in the hardware.

## Designing Your Own APIs

However, there will
be times when developers are creating their own components that they will be using for
years as their own products evolve.

APIs really don’t look any different then HALs do. They are simply function calls within an
application that have a public scope and can be accessed by any module. The only difference
is that the APIs are designed to make application development easier versus working
with hardware easier.

### Wrapping APIs

The components available on the market do not have a standard interface.
Developers can take the matter into their own hands and add an API wrapper to the components to
make them fit a standard interface.

Using a general wrapper in this way has many advantages, and there are quite a few
places where a developer may want to use a wrapper API, such as:

- RTOS calls
- Memory accesses
- File systems
- High-level components that require third-party software
- Circular buffers
- External devices

Using a wrapper is not all blue skies though. Every function call does incur a little bit
of overhead on the processor, and passing parameters into the function does use some
stack space. In most applications, the overhead performance hit and extra code will be
negligible. Developers should still be careful and aware that the wrapper does affect
performance and code size.

## Why Design Your Own APIs and HALs?

- Not wanting to be stuck using the vendor’s toolchain, which can be
costly and time consuming to change
- API is under copyright so it cannot be ported without being
completely rewritten
- API quality
- Coding standards
- Robustness
- Code size
- Quality
- Testability

## Comparing APIs and HALs

APIs and HALs have a lot in
common. In fact, in many circumstances developers may use the term API to include
both the low-level software and the high-level application software. Remember, HALs
interact with hardware at the lowest levels while an API interacts with other software
at a high level.
