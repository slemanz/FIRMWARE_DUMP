# 2. APIs and HALs

Designing a HAL is a great first step toward developing firmware that is
reusable and hardware independent. The HAL, or hardware abstraction layer, provides
the application developer with a standard function set that can be used to access
hardware functions without a detailed understanding of how the underlying hardware
works.
